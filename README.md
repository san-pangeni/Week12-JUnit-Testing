# Week12_JUnit_Testing

This project demonstrates the principles of unit testing in a Java environment. The primary objective is to verify the functionality of custom-written methods using the JUnit 5 framework. It encompasses writing standard tests, parameterized tests for comprehensive input validation, and using the Mockito framework to test methods with non-deterministic behavior.

### Project Implementation

#### 1. Project Setup and Configuration

* [cite_start]The project was initialized as a Maven project to manage its structure and dependencies systematically[cite: 46].
* The `pom.xml` file was configured to include the necessary dependencies for project execution and testing. [cite_start]Key dependencies include JUnit Jupiter for the testing framework, AssertJ for fluent assertions, and Mockito for creating mock objects [cite: 123-152].

#### 2. Core Functionality: `TestDemo.java`

* [cite_start]The main application logic resides in the `TestDemo.java` class[cite: 192].
* An `addPositive` method was implemented to calculate the sum of two integers, under the condition that both must be positive. [cite_start]If this condition is not met, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown [cite: 221-226].
* [cite_start]A `randomNumberSquared` method was created to return the square of a random integer generated by a separate `getRandomInt` method[cite: 353, 355].

#### 3. Unit Testing: `TestDemoJUnitTest.java`

* [cite_start]A corresponding test class, `TestDemoJUnitTest.java`, was created under `src/test/java` to house all unit tests[cite: 229].
* A parameterized test, `assertThatTwoPositiveNumbersAreAddedCorrectly`, was developed to validate the `addPositive` method. [cite_start]This test uses a `MethodSource` to supply a stream of arguments, covering both valid inputs and cases expected to throw an exception[cite: 271, 318].

#### 4. Mocking for Controlled Testing

* Testing the `randomNumberSquared` method presented a challenge due to the random nature of its dependency, `getRandomInt`.
* [cite_start]To facilitate a deterministic test, a spy of the `TestDemo` object was created using `Mockito.spy()`[cite: 374, 376].
* [cite_start]This spy object was programmed to return a specific value (5) whenever the `getRandomInt` method was invoked[cite: 379].
* [cite_start]This approach, known as mocking, allowed for the assertion that the `randomNumberSquared` method correctly returned the expected result (25), thereby isolating and verifying its squaring logic[cite: 383, 384].
