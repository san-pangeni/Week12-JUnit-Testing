### Week12_JUnit_Testing

This project demonstrates the principles of unit testing in a Java environment. The primary objective is to verify the functionality of custom-written methods using the JUnit 5 framework. It encompasses writing standard tests, parameterized tests for comprehensive input validation, and using the Mockito framework to test methods with non-deterministic behavior.

### Project Implementation

#### 1. Project Setup and Configuration

* The project was initialized as a Maven project to manage its structure and dependencies systematically.
* The `pom.xml` file was configured to include the necessary dependencies for project execution and testing. Key dependencies include JUnit Jupiter for the testing framework, AssertJ for fluent assertions, and Mockito for creating mock objects.

#### 2. Core Functionality: `TestDemo.java`

* The main application logic resides in the `TestDemo.java` class.
* An `addPositive` method was implemented to calculate the sum of two integers, under the condition that both must be positive. If this condition is not met, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.
* A `randomNumberSquared` method was created to return the square of a random integer generated by a separate `getRandomInt` method.

#### 3. Unit Testing: `TestDemoJUnitTest.java`

* A corresponding test class, `TestDemoJUnitTest.java`, was created under `src/test/java` to house all unit tests.
* A parameterized test, `assertThatTwoPositiveNumbersAreAddedCorrectly`, was developed to validate the `addPositive` method. This test uses a `MethodSource` to supply a stream of arguments, covering both valid inputs and cases expected to throw an exception.

#### 4. Mocking for Controlled Testing

* Testing the `randomNumberSquared` method presented a challenge due to the random nature of its dependency, `getRandomInt`.
* To facilitate a deterministic test, a spy of the `TestDemo` object was created using `Mockito.spy()`.
* This spy object was programmed to return a specific value (5) whenever the `getRandomInt` method was invoked.
* This approach, known as mocking, allowed for the assertion that the `randomNumberSquared` method correctly returned the expected result (25), thereby isolating and verifying its squaring logic.
